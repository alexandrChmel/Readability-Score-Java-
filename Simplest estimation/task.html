<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>Ever wondered how to assess if the text is hard or easy to read? For a human, this task is pretty simple: you just read the text and feel if you're struggling or not. But how to teach a computer do that? In this project, you will write such a program.</p><p>Firstly, let's create a simple program. If a text contains more than 100 symbols (including spaces and punctuation), then it is considered hard to read. Otherwise, the text is considered easy to read. If a text contains exactly 100 symbols, it is still easy to read.</p><p>The input contains a single line of text. Output "HARD" if the text is hard to read and "EASY" if the text is easy to read.</p><h5 id="examples">Examples</h5><p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p><p><strong>Example 1</strong>: the text that has less than 100 symbols.</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; This text is easy to read!
EASY</code></pre><p><strong>Example 2</strong>: the text that has more than 100 symbols.</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; This text is hard to read. It contains a lot of sentences as well as a lot of words in each sentence.
HARD</code></pre><p><strong>Example 3</strong>: the text has lots of spaces and 104 symbols, making it hard to read.</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; # T h i s  t e x t  h a s  a  l o t  o f  s p a c e s  a n d  p u n c t u a t i o n  m a r k s ! ! ! ! !
HARD</code></pre><p><strong>Example 4</strong>: the text has lots of spaces and only 93 symbols, making it easy to read.</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; T h i s  t e x t  h a s  a  l o t  o f  s p a c e s  t o o  b u t  i s  e a s y  t o  r e a d
